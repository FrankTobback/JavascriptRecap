## 1.1 - Color selector

Display three buttons named "Blue", "Red" and "Green" as well as a `<div>` shaped like a square which should be black by default.

When you click on any of these buttons it should change the color of the `<div>` to the corresponding color.

## 1.2 - Calculator

Display two text boxes and four buttons named "+", "-", "x" and "/". Make the calculator work correctly by displaying the result of the operation when the user clicks one of the buttons.

## 1.3 - Super Vilain application form

Display a form asking for the user's super vilain name, super power, motivation and plan to conquer the world.

The form should have two buttons, "Reset" and "Display". When clicking "Reset" it should erase the value of all the form elements to allow re-entering everything. When clicking "Display" it should erase the whole form and the buttons from the screen and display a text with headers showing the result collected in the previous form.

When it's done, fill the form, display the result, print it and give it to your coach. He received special instructions and knows what to do with it.

## 1.4 - Age calculator

Display three select boxes allowing to enter a birthdate. When the user selects a value for each of the select boxes, display its age.

Bonus: Make your components smart by making it impossible to enter a date that doesn't exist. (Like 1990-04-31 or 1991-02-29.)
